Screen Sizer is a web tool designed to help you in testing your responsive webdesign, by allowing you to easily check how your website renders under different resolutions.

Screen Sizer is *heavily* inspired from [Quirktools Screenfly](http://quirktools.com/screenfly). The main differences are :
    
- Licence:  Screen Sizer is free and open-source, licensed under GPLv3
- Internationalization: at the moment, Screen Sizer is available in French and English, but can be easily translated to other languages

- Customizable : you can provide your own CSS, or even recreate
